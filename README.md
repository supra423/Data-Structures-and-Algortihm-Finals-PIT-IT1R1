# Data-Structures-and-Algortihm-Finals-PIT-IT1R1

This is for a school project.

this project is just a short demonstration on how
sorting algorithms can be used in real life scenarios.

in this project I demonstrated quicksort by sorting student
according to what is being specified. They can be sorted
alphabetically, or numerically using their student number or
grade. Binary search is also demonstrated here which searches a
student by just entering the name or student number. These
algotihms are written in the "myAlgorithms.py" file.
