# Data-Structures-and-Algortihm-Finals-PIT-IT1R1

This is for a school project.

this project is just a short demonstration on how
sorting algorithms can be used in real life scenarios.

in this project I demonstrated quicksort by sorting students
according to what is being specified. They can be sorted 
alphabetically, or numerically using their student number or
grade
