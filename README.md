Performance Innovative Task
IT122 – Data Structures and Algorithms
2nd Sem SY. 2024 – 2025
Course Outcomes:

- CO1: 
  Design, implement, test, and debug a program with abstract data types (linked list,
stacks, queues, priority queues, trees, and sorting algorithms).
- CO2: 
  Apply various data structures and algorithms in Python programming language.
- Goal
  The goal of this project is to apply data structures and algorithms concepts
to solve a real-world problem efficiently using Python. Students will
demonstrate their understanding of DSA principles while improving their
programming skills.
- Role
  Students will act as software developers tasked with designing and
implementing a Python program that solves a given problem using
appropriate data structures (e.g., lists, stacks, queues,
trees) and algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic
programming).
- Audience End-users: 
  People who will benefit from the program (e.g., students,
teachers, small business owners).
Stakeholders: The instructor and peers who will evaluate the program’s
efficiency, correctness, and design.
- Situation
  The students will utilize any system they have in Computer Programming 2.
The primary goal of IT122 PIT is to verify and implement all DSA concepts.
Please see the attached table for more detailed requirements. (page 2)

Product/Performance
Students will submit:

1. A Python Program
  - Uses Computer Programming 2 skills (e.g., classes, file I/O,
  error handling).
  -Clearly implements DSA concepts (e.g., "This function uses
a merge sort algorithm for O(n log n) efficiency").
  - Will be graded as PIT (50/50)
2. Presentation/Demo
  - Shows the program’s functionality.
  - Highlights where and why DSA was used.
  - Explain how DSA improved the solution vs. a brute-force
approach.
  - Will be graded as Midterm Lab Exam (30/30)

- Standard
  Your output will be graded based on the rubrics.

To pass this project, your implementation must:
1. Integrate at least 5 distinct Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts from the

topics covered this term (see table below).
2. Clearly demonstrate their application in your code, documentation/presentation.

DSA Concepts Concepts to Check Expected Features


Arrays/Lists 
▪ Traversal, insertion, deletion
▪ Dynamic resizing
▪ Basic operations (searching, sorting)
▪ Implement a dynamic list with
user input.
▪ Perform operations like
reversing, finding max/min.


Stacks (LIFO) 
▪ Push, pop, peek
▪ Applications (e.g., undo/redo,
parenthesis balancing)
▪ Simulate a browser history
(back button).
▪ Check balanced parentheses in
an expression.


Queues (FIFO) ▪ Enqueue, dequeue
▪ Priority queues
▪ Simulate a printer queue.
▪ Prioritize tasks by urgency.


Linked Lists 
▪ Node traversal, insertion,
deletion
▪ Singly or Doubly linked lists
▪ Implement add/remove item or
element.


Binary Search
Trees (BST)
▪ Traversals (in-order, pre-order,
post-order)
▪ Insertion, deletion, searching
▪ Implement a dictionary using BST.
▪ Find the smallest/largest element.

Sorting & Searching Algorithms
▪ Sorting (merge sort, quicksort,
bubble sort)
▪ Searching (binary search)
▪ Sort elements by
▪ Implement a binary search on a
sorted list.
